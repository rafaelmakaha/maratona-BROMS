# BROMS

BROMS is a web Scoreboard built with vanilla Javascript.
It's goal is to present live competition hosted on a [BOCA](https://www.ime.usp.br/~cassio/boca/)

BROMS's is currently under development with many points to improve. If you have any suggestion or
comments, feel free to open an issue or send an e-mail.


## Instructions

BROMS is a front-end web app. It needs to be feeded from a source.
The primary source should be a [BOCA](https://www.ime.usp.br/~cassio/boca/), **but**
We made an [API Mock](https://github.com/rafaelmakaha/api-mock-BROMS) to simulate a competition.

Requirements:

- Python 3
- Browser capable of running ES6 Javascript modules

### Run BROMS server

To run BROMS, enter the following command on your terminal

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

you can check the application on your browser on [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/)
